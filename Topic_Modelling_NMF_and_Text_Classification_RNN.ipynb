Vaccinations for children under the age of 60, which are already in progress, are also temporarily suspended. It is interpreted that the British AstraZeneca vaccine decided to postpone the vaccination until the review was completed at home and abroad as controversy continued over the problem of thrombus formation after inoculation.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 Vaccination Response Promotion Team held an expert advisory meeting on the 7th and announced that the decision was made. \"As the European Medicines Agency (EMA) General Assembly is reviewing the link between the vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University in the UK and the occurrence of some specific thrombosis, we have decided to confirm the results and push forward,\" the committee said.\\n\\nAccordingly, special education and childcare workers, public health teachers, nurses at daycare centers, and facilities for the disabled who were scheduled to start new vaccinations this week will postpone the start of vaccination, and those under the age of 60 who are already vaccinated will be vaccinated temporarily. withhold\\n\\nThe promotion team closely monitors the occurrence of similar cases at home and abroad, and provides information to the public that has been reviewed with experts from related societies so that they can recognize and receive treatment for adverse reactions early after vaccination, including TV subtitles, card news, posters, and videos. We plan to promote it.\\n\\nJung Eun-kyung, head of the promotion group, said on the same day, \"This measure is a preemptive measure considering the safety of those vaccinated against COVID-19.\\n\\nInitially, the government decided to shorten the inoculation period for some of those eligible to be vaccinated in the second quarter in order to quickly increase the number of people vaccinated against COVID-19. However, the decision seems to have been made because the causal relationship between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots has not been clearly established. \"It is becoming increasingly difficult to say that there is no causal link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the very rare thrombosis associated with low platelet levels,\" the Italian daily Il Mesazero said in the words of Marco Cavaleri, head of EMA\\'s vaccine strategy. \"He said.\\n\\nOn the other hand, AFP news agency announced that the EMA will announce the evaluation results on the relationship between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots through a briefing on the 7th at 0 PM Korean time.'"

The heartache caused by distance, isolation, and lack of communication became a concern that no one could easily come forward and comfort.\\nI long for something that can warmly comfort my weary heart.\\nThis book \\'Painting Meditation\\' is an art essay that I try to think through pictures in everyday life. It is also an attempt to revisit art from a more diverse and expanded perspective.\\nThe way to understand and become familiar with painting was approached as if \\'meditating\\'.\\nNormal meditation begins with closing your eyes and immersing yourself in quiet contemplation. You can see the picture with your eyes closed.\\nBecause the heart also has eyes. is the heart.\\nAuthor Yunseop Kim said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis book \\xe2\\x80\\x98Picture Meditation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is also one of the practical ways to guide you to a better and more interesting life as art.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98What is the hidden value of art?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 This book started from the questions, \\'How can I easily understand art with my own thoughts?\\'\" he said.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to try hard to talk to the painting.

It helps to start or end the day on a positive note.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\'Picture Meditation\\', which contains the works of 22 domestic contemporary artists, starts with \\'opening the door of thought in the most comfortable position\\' and provides a generous empty space to comfort the mind.\\nThey are mostly painters in their 40s and 60s.

As yellow dust and fine dust disappear, the air quality is also good.\\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration predicted that the whole country would be on the edge of high pressure moving eastward in the East Sea.\\nIt is expected that raindrops will fall in the western regions due to the influence of the pressure valley moving eastward near Shanghai, China.\\nIn the West Sea 5 provinces, it is expected that rain of around 5 mm will fall from 6 pm to 12 pm on that day.\\nThe rain is expected to spread across the country on the 3rd weekend.\\nThe lowest temperature in the morning is expected to be 5 to 13 degrees, and the highest temperature during the day is expected to be 14 to 23 degrees.\\nThe daytime temperature will rise by more than 20 degrees in most parts of the country, but Yeongdong, Gangwon and eastern parts of North Gyeongsang Province are cool around 15 degrees Celsius as the east wind blows in.\\nThe Korea Meteorological Administration emphasized, \"Inland, the temperature difference between day and night will reach around 15 degrees.\"\\nDue to the smooth air diffusion, the concentration of fine dust and ultrafine dust is expected to show \\'good\\' to \\'normal\\' levels in all areas.\\nThe air is very dry in Yeongdong, Gangwon, the east coast of Gyeongsang Province, and some inland areas in Gyeongsangbuk-do, where a dry warning is in effect.\\nThe wave of the sea is expected to rise at a height of 0.5 to 3 m in the waters off the West Sea, in the South and East Seas, and at a maximum of 4 m in the far seas of the West, South and East Seas.\\nAll over the southern and southern seas of the East Sea, winds blow strongly at 35 to 60 km/h, and waves can rise as high as 1.5 to 4 m.\\nOn the coast of Gyeongsang Province, the southern coast of Jeollanam-do, and Jeju Island, there are places where high waves caused by swells exceed coastal roads, tidal rocks, and breakwaters.'\n",
            " b'Presbyopia is a change in the eyes that loses near vision due to a decrease in the elasticity of the lens. Symptoms usually start to feel in the early 40s, and the symptoms get progressively worse until the 60s.\\n\\nIt is unavoidable, but people want to face presbyopia even a little bit slowly. Is there any way to cure presbyopia?\\n\\nBright lighting, reading large text Helps with early symptoms of presbyopia\\nBecause presbyopia is a natural phenomenon of aging, it is impossible to treat it in a way that eliminates the root cause like other diseases. It should be borne in mind that the goal of presbyopia treatment is to reduce the discomfort caused by presbyopia.\\n\\nThe treatment method to minimize the symptoms of presbyopia is the use of bright lighting and viewing of large letters. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said, \"If more ambient light is turned on, the pupil narrows and the depth of focus increases, so it may help early symptoms of presbyopia.\" Also, \"It is good to read a book in large print or to enlarge the text and pictures on the computer screen or smartphone.\"\\n\\nAnother treatment for presbyopia is the use of a magnifying glass. The use of magnifying glasses for near vision correction is the most basic treatment for presbyopia. For presbyopia correction, glasses for distance and near can be used separately, or bifocal or progressive multifocal lens glasses can be worn as needed.\\n\\nHowever, it should be remembered that presbyopia and reduced vision are two different issues. Since there is a possibility that there may be other causes of vision loss other than presbyopia, it is necessary to see an ophthalmologist.'\n",

            "Original:  b'Presbyopia is a change in the eyes that loses near vision due to a decrease in the elasticity of the lens. Symptoms usually start to feel in the early 40s, and the symptoms get progressively worse until the 60s.\\n\\nIt is unavoidable, but people want to face presbyopia even a little bit slowly. Is there any way to cure presbyopia?\\n\\nBright lighting, reading large text Helps with early symptoms of presbyopia\\nBecause presbyopia is a natural phenomenon of aging, it is impossible to treat it in a way that eliminates the root cause like other diseases. It should be borne in mind that the goal of presbyopia treatment is to reduce the discomfort caused by presbyopia.\\n\\nThe treatment method to minimize the symptoms of presbyopia is the use of bright lighting and viewing of large letters. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said, \"If more ambient light is turned on, the pupil narrows and the depth of focus increases, so it may help early symptoms of presbyopia.\" Also, \"It is good to read a book in large print or to enlarge the text and pictures on the computer screen or smartphone.\"\\n\\nAnother treatment for presbyopia is the use of a magnifying glass. The use of magnifying glasses for near vision correction is the most basic treatment for presbyopia. For presbyopia correction, glasses for distance and near can be used separately, or bifocal or progressive multifocal lens glasses can be worn as needed.\\n\\nHowever, it should be remembered that presbyopia and reduced vision are two different issues. Since there is a possibility that there may be other causes of vision loss other than presbyopia, it is necessary to see an ophthalmologist.'\n",
